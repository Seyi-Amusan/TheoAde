            <p class="mb-6">I design brilliant websites that are fully optimized for conversion. Whether for your personal brand or business, a good website is a good investment, especially if you are in it for the long haul. A good website does three things: it <span class="underline">connects with</span> the right type of audience, <span class="underline">leads people</span> to your <span class="underline">core offerings</span> (they must be able to tell in clear terms what you do), and <span class="underline">collects their contact details</span> for future business relationships. </p>
            <p class="mb-6">Sadly, most websites are boring billboards of information that do not serve the owner. They fail to reflect novelty, and visitors simply come, look around, remember nothing, feel overwhelmed, and leave.</p>
            <div class="mb-6">
                <p class="mb-2">Which is what we do differently…or which is where I come in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>• First we understand your goals for setting up the website </li>
                    <li>• Then we streamline your message so that you get known for a singular, important message</li>
                    <li>• Then we lay out a good design with a stunning, website architecture…</li>
                    <li>• Then we integrate relevant plug-ins to track and optimize performance… </li>
                    <li>• Then we refine the overall experience…</li>
                    <li>• Bearing in mind the three vital functions of a website…connecting, leading, & conversion</li>

        <p class="mb-6">I work with authors to bring their best work into the world. It’s tough enough to write a book. But do you know what is tougher? Refining it. Removing the deadwood from your writing and acknowledging the need for a second eye.</p>
        <p class="mb-6">How do you do that when you don’t yet know your book will sell? So, I understand. I get where most authors come from.</p>
        <p class="mb-6">But the last thing you want is for a reader to scoff your brainchild, note your name, and swear he will never read your stuff again; to watch your books gather dusts at home and given as unwanted souvenirs at events</p>
        <p class="mb-6">As one of the scarce few editors who <span class="span-text">hears</span> good writing and <span class="span-text">understands</span> the art, I can work with you to bring your best work into the world. 26 Manuscripts refined to perfection, hanging on different corners of the internet say so.</p>
