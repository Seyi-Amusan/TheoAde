            <p class="mb-6">I design brilliant websites that are fully optimized for conversion. Whether for your personal brand or business, a good website is a good investment, especially if you are in it for the long haul. A good website does three things: it <span class="underline">connects with</span> the right type of audience, <span class="underline">leads people</span> to your <span class="underline">core offerings</span> (they must be able to tell in clear terms what you do), and <span class="underline">collects their contact details</span> for future business relationships. </p>
            <p class="mb-6">Sadly, most websites are boring billboards of information that do not serve the owner. They fail to reflect novelty, and visitors simply come, look around, remember nothing, feel overwhelmed, and leave.</p>
            <div class="mb-6">
                <p class="mb-2">Which is what we do differently…or which is where I come in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>• First we understand your goals for setting up the website </li>
                    <li>• Then we streamline your message so that you get known for a singular, important message</li>
                    <li>• Then we lay out a good design with a stunning, website architecture…</li>
                    <li>• Then we integrate relevant plug-ins to track and optimize performance… </li>
                    <li>• Then we refine the overall experience…</li>
                    <li>• Bearing in mind the three vital functions of a website…connecting, leading, & conversion</li>

        <p class="mb-6">I work with creators and entrepreneurs to design smart funnels
            that sell their product or service digitally.</p>
        <p class="mb-6">A funnel is a sequence of steps that a prospect goes through 
            before they buy from you. This can be as simple as your traffic—
            sales page—purchase, or a little more intricate as your traffic—
            quiz—opt-in page—email sequences—sales page—purchase. I 
            work with you to define the best funnel for your product or 
            service, craft the copies, and help you design a well-optimized 
            funnel. Then we automate the process, and your only goal will 
            be to drive traffic to the front of the funnel and watch the magic 
            happen.

        <h4 class="mb-2 tertiary">Writing Training</h4>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p class="mb-6"> help creators and professionals rise above the limitations of 
            terrible writing. If you make evasive mistakes in your writings, it 
            can be tasking to overcome it yourself. Learning to write well can 
            be boring and overwhelming.</p>
        <p class="mb-6">The rules of writing seem <span class="underline">endless</span> and very few people are able to 
            connect them. Online courses <span class="underline">barely touch the foundations</span> and 
            books dwell too much on terminologies. So, you waste time.
            Thus, what I do differently. </p>
        <p class="mb-6">I teach you to build a coherent loop to UNDERSTAND the subtle 
            nuances that make all the difference. I help you understand good 
            grammar and writing so you can win a special place in the heart of 
            your audience. I help you write well for yourself. I bring to class 
            my passion, knowledge from more than 6 books on the subject, 
            many conscious trainings on writing and editing, personal 
            experience from writing and teaching others, stories, and above 
            all, simplicity.</p>
