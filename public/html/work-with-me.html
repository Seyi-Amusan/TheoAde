                <p class="mb-6">I design brilliant websites that are fully optimized for conversion. Whether for your personal brand or business, a good website is a good investment, especially if you are in it for the long haul. A good website does three things: it <span class="underline">connects with</span> the right type of audience, <span class="underline">leads people</span> to your <span class="underline">core offerings</span> (they must be able to tell in clear terms what you do), and <span class="underline">collects their contact details</span> for future business relationships. </p>
                <p class="mb-6">Sadly, most websites are boring billboards of information that do not serve the owner. They fail to reflect novelty, and visitors simply come, look around, remember nothing, feel overwhelmed, and leave.</p>

                        <li>• First we understand your goals for setting up the website </li>
                        <li>• Then we streamline your message so that you get known for a singular, important message</li>
                        <li>• Then we lay out a good design with a stunning, website architecture…</li>
                        <li>• Then we integrate relevant plug-ins to track and optimize performance… </li>
                        <li>• Then we refine the overall experience…</li>

            <p class="mb-6">I work with creators and entrepreneurs to design smart funnels
                that sell their product or service digitally.</p>
            <p class="mb-6">A funnel is a sequence of steps that a prospect goes through 
                before they buy from you. This can be as simple as your traffic—
                sales page—purchase, or a little more intricate as your traffic—
                quiz—opt-in page—email sequences—sales page—purchase. I 
                work with you to define the best funnel for your product or 
                service, craft the copies, and help you design a well-optimized 
                funnel. Then we automate the process, and your only goal will 
                be to drive traffic to the front of the funnel and watch the magic 
                happen.

            <img src="" alt="">
            <p class="mb-6">I work with authors to bring their best work into the world. It’s tough enough to write a book. But do you know what is tougher? Refining it. Removing the deadwood from your writing and acknowledging the need for a second eye.</p>
            <p class="mb-6">How do you do that when you don’t yet know your book will sell? So, I understand. I get where most authors come from.</p>
            <p class="mb-6">But the last thing you want is for a reader to scoff your brainchild, note your name, and swear he will never read your stuff again; to watch your books gather dusts at home and given as unwanted souvenirs at events</p>
            <p class="mb-6">As one of the scarce few editors who <span class="span-text">hears</span> good writing and <span class="span-text">understands</span> the art, I can work with you to bring your best work into the world. 26 Manuscripts refined to perfection, hanging on different corners of the internet say so.</p>

            <img src="" alt="">
            <p class="mb-6">I help creators and professionals rise above the limitations of 
                terrible writing. If you make evasive mistakes in your writings, it 
                can be tasking to overcome it yourself. Learning to write well can 
                be boring and overwhelming.</p>
            <p class="mb-6">The rules of writing seem <span class="underline">endless</span> and very few people are able to 
                connect them. Online courses <span class="underline">barely touch the foundations</span> and 
                books dwell too much on terminologies. So, you waste time.
                Thus, what I do differently. </p>
            <p class="mb-6">I teach you to build a coherent loop to UNDERSTAND the subtle 
                nuances that make all the difference. I help you understand good 
                grammar and writing so you can win a special place in the heart of 
                your audience. I help you write well for yourself. I bring to class 
                my passion, knowledge from more than 6 books on the subject, 
                many conscious trainings on writing and editing, personal 
                experience from writing and teaching others, stories, and above 
                all, simplicity.</p>
