                <p class="marginBottom-text hover-text">
                    Ever been in one of those situations where you know the right response but only after the 
                    conversation has happened? That feeling, right? So is my journey. Except I’m one of the 
                    weird persons who turn back and send a message if it is worth it.

                    I graduated at 20 as one of the best students in Mining Engineering but didn’t secure a 
                    rewarding job until I turned 26. I found myself teaching for five years, navigating seven 
                    schools and many private estates in Lagos.

                    And while education is noble in theory, its reality falls short—with rigid administrators who 
                    prioritize students over teachers, who fail to acknowledge the changing landscape and 
                    perpetuate ignorance by providing shortcuts in external exams; with parents who view 
                    hiring teachers as a favour rather than a partnership; with distracted students who demand 
                    endless repetitions, all worsened by a meagre salary will definitely drive you nut

                    A desire to change the system and create a community for graduate teachers led me to 
                    launch a tutoring agency in 2019, setting me out on what you will call “entrepreneurship”. 
                    From there, I saw the need to thoroughly understand <span class="span-text">marketing</span>.</p>
                <p class="marginBottom-text hover-text">
                    I've trodden a challenging road, learning survival, self-motivation, and a myriad of skills. 
                    The traditional learning path proved incomplete and left me searching for new ways.

                <p class="marginBottom-text hover-text">
                    My mission is clear: To bridge that gap for students and shorten the journey to relevance 
                    for graduates and young professionals. You don't have to settle in a world filled with 
                    countless options.
