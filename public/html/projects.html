                <p>Transparent education for the modern-day student. |</p>

                <p>I believe in education that will make every individual his own sovereign entity. There are many loops in our educational system which leaves many students to graduate scared, anxious, frustrated, and drifting.</p>

                    <p>Schools teach all topics in bits...and due to inconsistencies in its processes, you will lose some parts.</p>
                    <p>We aim to build coherence and build that faster</p>
                    <p>School lessons are incomplete—both in preparing students for higher institutions and helping them post-graduation.</p>
                    <p>We aim to help students beyond school schemes through early exposure to the right information</p>
                    <p>Schools teach tools and not problem-solving; talks about wrenches and spanners instead of dismantling an engine</p>
                    <p>We believe a lot will change if we simply start all our lessons with WHY</p>
                    <p>Schools don’t solve the career direction issue, nor do schools build a community</p>
                    <p>But we will help students break through the noise for more decisive career decisions and build the first, lasting community</p>

                <p>These, among other issues, are what we aim to solve through @ischoollabs, starting primarily with high school students.
                    I believe high-school learning is a movement waiting to happen. 
                    Many programs and opportunities focus on graduates and postgraduates, and have left the bright minds in high school to rote 
                    learning, overwhelming distractions, and figuring things out on 
                    their own much later in life through gambling, luck, and trial and 
                    error. 
                    But proper education should be transparent and empowering</p>
